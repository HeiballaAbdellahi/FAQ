<div><div id="question0_0" class="faqQuestion">What is the difference between an affidavit and a statutory declaration?</div><div class="faqAnswer"><div><p>An affidavit is a sworn statement of facts that has been written down and sworn to by the affiant before individuals who are authorized to administer oaths.  A statutory declaration is similar to an affidavit except that a statutory declaration is usually used outside of court settings. For example, proof of death to be used for land transfer when one of the grantor dies.  These types of declarations are made subject to the provisions of certain legislation.  Generally, a statutory declaration has the same force of effect as if made under oath.
